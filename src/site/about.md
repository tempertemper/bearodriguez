Life's challenges—whether it's loss, change, or unresolved experiences from the past—can leave us feeling stuck, disconnected, or unsure of ourselves. Therapy offers a space to explore these experiences, make sense of them, and move toward greater clarity, confidence, and balance.

I believe that within each of us lies an innate drive toward healing and wholeness. My role is to help you connect with that inner force, offering a safe, supportive, and non-judgmental space where you can reflect, heal, and find your way forward.

We are relational beings, and connection is at the heart of meaningful change. In therapy, I aim to offer what a good human relationship provides: someone to truly listen, to gently challenge, to encourage, and to hold hope with you—especially when it feels hard to hold it for yourself.


## Qualifications

I'm a qualified as Psychotherapeutic counsellor and I also hold a BSc (Hons) in Psychology. I'm a registered member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (MBACP) and adhere to their Ethical Framework, ensuring that the therapy I offer is both safe and professional. I've lived in the UK for over 25 years but I'm originally from Spain and I offer counselling in both languages.


## My experience

I have experience supporting clients with a wide range of issues, including anxiety, depression, trauma, and grief. I also have a particular interest in working with attachment issues, codependency, and narcissistic patterns, whether you're navigating the effects of these dynamics or seeking to better understand your own relational style.


## My approach

My work is rooted in Transactional Analysis, helping us understand patterns in thoughts, feelings, and relationships. I also draw on attachment theory and psychodynamic and person-centred approaches, exploring experiences deeply while keeping the therapeutic relationship at the heart of the work.

Together, we'll look at the thoughts and emotions that may be holding you back, uncover new ways of responding, and reconnect with your inner resources. Therapy is a collaborative space for self-awareness, growth, and meaningful change, supported by understanding, reflection, and connection.
