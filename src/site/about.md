Starting therapy can feel like a big step, and most people feel nervous or unsure about starting that journey. My role is to offer you a safe, compassionate space where you can talk openly, be heard and seen so you can begin to make sense of what's happening for you.

I've got experience of working with people with a wide range of issues such as anxiety, depression, trauma and grief.  But I have a special interest in attachment issues, codependency, narcissistic tendencies as well as boundary setting.

I hold a BSc (Hons) in Psychology and a Diploma in Psychotherapeutic Counselling. I am a registered member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (MBACP) and follow their Ethical Principles and Guidelines, so you can feel confident in the quality and integrity of the therapy I provide.
