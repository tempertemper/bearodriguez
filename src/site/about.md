I hold a BSc (Hons) in Psychology and a Diploma in Psychotherapeutic Counselling. I am a registered member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (MBACP) and follow their Ethical Principles and Guidelines, so you can feel confident in the quality and integrity of the therapy I provide.
