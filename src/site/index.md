Starting therapy can feel like a big step. My aim is to make that first step easier by offering a warm, accepting space where you can feel supported from the start.

I use different approaches to suit your needs, with a strong focus on the relationship we build together. Drawing on psychodynamic thinking, we'll explore how your past may shape your present, helping you understand yourself more fully and create space for change.

Clients often tell me they feel 'seen' in our sessions; able to be open without hiding parts of themselves. Together, we can uncover patterns that hold you back and work towards greater freedom, choice, and self-understanding.

I hold a BSc (Hons) in Psychology and a Diploma in Psychotherapeutic Counselling. I am a registered member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (MBACP) and follow their Ethical Principles and Guidelines, so you can feel confident in the quality and integrity of the therapy I provide.

I have experience and a special interest in supporting people with challenges such as:

- [People pleasing, codependency and boundary setting](/expertise/codependency)
- [Relationship and attachment difficulties](/expertise/attachment)
- [Low self-worth and shame](/expertise/self-worth)

I can also work with anxiety, depression, bereavement, trauma, abuse, obsessions to just name a few.

Seeking help early is key to mental health, so reaching out before you feel at breaking point can make a real difference. I look forward to supporting you as we move together towards where you want to be.
