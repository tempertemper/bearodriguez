## My approach

Starting therapy can feel like a big step; you don't have to do it alone. My aim is to make that first step easier by offering a warm, accepting space where you can feel supported from the start.

I adapt therapy to your individual needs. Together, we'll explore how your past experiences can shape your thoughts, emotions, and relationships today. This understanding can help you feel more self-assured, connected, and able to create meaningful change in your life.
