When you begin therapy with me, you'll have a space where you can talk openly and be met with warmth, curiosity, and no judgment. Whether you're feeling anxious or low, finding relationships difficult, or noticing unhelpful patterns that keep repeating — we'll work together to make sense of what's going on.

Together, we'll explore the links between your thoughts, emotions, behaviours, and past experiences. Over time, this process can help you understand yourself more deeply and respond to life with greater compassion and clarity.


## The First Session

Our first session is a chance to get to know each other and see how it feels to work together. We'll talk about what's brought you to therapy and what you're hoping for — but there's no pressure to have clear goals straight away. Some people come simply for a space to talk and see what unfolds.


## How Therapy Can Help

Therapy can support you to:

- Feel calmer and more grounded when life feels overwhelming
- Build confidence and a stronger sense of who you are
- Recognise unhelpful patterns and make different choices
- Improve relationships and communication
- Develop practical ways to manage anxiety, stress, or low mood


## Sessions and Availability

Sessions last 50 minutes and take place weekly — either:

- **In person** in Newcastle upon Tyne or Tynemouth
- **Online** via secure video, from wherever you are

The consistency of weekly sessions helps the work go deeper and gives you regular time to reflect, process, and grow.


## You Set the Pace

There's no right or wrong way to start therapy. Wherever you're coming from, you'll be met with care, respect, and curiosity. The space is yours — to feel seen, heard, and supported as you begin to make meaningful change.
