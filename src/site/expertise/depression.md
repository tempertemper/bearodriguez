Depression can make even simple tasks feel exhausting and leave you feeling disconnected from yourself and others. You might notice a constant low mood, loss of motivation, difficulty sleeping, or a sense of emptiness that's hard to explain.

Therapy offers space to slow down and talk openly about what you're going through. Together, we can explore the experiences, thoughts, and patterns that contribute to how you feel, and begin to find ways forward that bring relief and meaning.

Therapy can help you:

- Understand the underlying causes of low mood
- Develop self-compassion and resilience
- Find ways to manage negative thoughts and emotions
- Reconnect with motivation, purpose, and hope

Depression can feel isolating, but you don't have to face it alone. Therapy provides consistent support as you start to rediscover balance and a renewed sense of self.
