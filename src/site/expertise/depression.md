When you're feeling low, even simple tasks can feel overwhelming. You might notice a constant sadness, loss of motivation, difficulty sleeping, or a sense of emptiness that's hard to describe.

In therapy, we'll make space to talk openly about what you're going through. Together, we'll explore the experiences, thoughts, and patterns shaping how you feel, and begin finding ways forward that bring relief, self-understanding, and hope.

Therapy can help you:

- Understand the underlying causes of low mood
- Develop self-compassion and resilience
- Manage negative thoughts and emotions
- Reconnect with motivation, purpose, and meaning
