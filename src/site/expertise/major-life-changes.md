Periods of change can bring uncertainty, loss, or a sense of being unmoored. Whether you're adjusting to a new stage of life or recovering from an unexpected event, therapy offers a space to explore what these shifts mean for you.

Major life changes might include:

- Divorce or separation
- Career change or redundancy
- Parenthood or becoming a carer
- Retirement or relocation
- Midlife transitions or menopause

Even positive changes can stir up old feelings or challenge your sense of identity. In therapy, we'll look at what's happening beneath the surface, exploring how past experiences, expectations, and emotions shape your response so you can navigate this stage with greater clarity and confidence.
