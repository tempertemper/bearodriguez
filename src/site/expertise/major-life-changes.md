Periods of change can bring uncertainty, loss, or a sense of being unmoored. Whether you're adjusting to a new stage of life or recovering from an unexpected event, therapy offers space to explore what these shifts mean for you.

Major life changes can include:

- Divorce or separation
- Career change or redundancy
- Parenthood or becoming a carer
- Retirement or moving home
- Midlife transitions or menopause

Even when change is positive, it can stir up old feelings or challenge your sense of identity. Together, we'll look at what's happening beneath the surface; how past experiences, expectations, and emotions interact, so you can begin to navigate this stage with more confidence and clarity.

Therapy can help you process loss, adjust to new realities, and reconnect with what matters most to you as you move forward.
