Relationships are central to our wellbeing, but they can also be a source of stress, confusion, and pain. You might be feeling unheard, disconnected, or caught in repeating patterns that leave you frustrated or lonely.

Therapy offers a safe space to explore how you relate to others and what might be getting in the way of closeness or communication. We can look at what happens in your relationships — both past and present — to help you understand your needs, boundaries, and emotional responses.

Through this process, you can begin to:

- Communicate more clearly and assertively
- Recognise and change unhelpful relationship patterns
- Develop healthier boundaries and self-awareness
- Build more fulfilling connections with others

Whether you're struggling with a partner, family member, friend, or colleague, therapy can help you find new ways of relating that feel more balanced and authentic.
