Difficulties with food can be about much more than eating itself. They often develop as a way of coping with painful emotions, stress, or a sense of lacking control. You might find that thoughts about food, weight, or body image have started to take up too much space in your life.

Therapy offers a safe and non-judgmental space to explore what sits beneath these struggles. Together, we'll look at the feelings, experiences, and patterns that influence your relationship with food and your body.

Therapy can help you:

- Understand the emotional roots of disordered eating
- Develop healthier ways to manage difficult feelings
- Strengthen self-esteem and body acceptance
- Rebuild a more balanced relationship with food
