Low self-esteem can affect how you see yourself and how you relate to others. You might feel not good enough, worry about what people think, or find it hard to trust your own judgement. Over time, this can lead to self-criticism, anxiety, or withdrawing from relationships and opportunities.

In therapy, we'll explore where these feelings come from and how past experiences or relationships may have shaped the way you see yourself. Understanding these patterns is the first step toward changing them.

Together, we can work to:

- Build self-acceptance and confidence
- Develop a kinder inner voice
- Recognise your strengths and achievements
- Feel more comfortable expressing needs and boundaries

Therapy can help you rebuild a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself, so you can move through life with greater confidence and ease.
