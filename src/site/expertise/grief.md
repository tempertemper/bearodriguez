title: Grief
description: Space to process loss at your own pace and begin rebuilding a sense of stability, meaning, and peace.
intro: Grief is a natural reaction to loss that can take many forms, such as the death of someone close, the end of a relationship, a change in health, or another major life shift. Grief can feel overwhelming, unpredictable, and deeply personal. There's no right or wrong way to grieve, and no fixed timeline for how long it lasts.

Therapy offers space to talk about your loss openly and honestly, without pressure to 'move on' or make sense of it before you're ready. Together, we can explore the emotions that come with grief, including sadness, anger, guilt, and confusion.

Therapy can help you:

- Make sense of the changes that loss brings
- Find ways to stay connected to what you've lost
- Process difficult emotions safely
- Reconnect with hope and meaning as you move forward
