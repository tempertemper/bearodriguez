Loss can take many forms, such as the death of someone close, the end of a relationship, a change in health, or another major life shift. Grief can feel overwhelming, unpredictable, and deeply personal. There's no right or wrong way to grieve, and no fixed timeline for how long it lasts.

Therapy offers space to talk about your loss openly and honestly, without pressure to 'move on' or make sense of it before you're ready. Together, we can explore the emotions that come with grief, including sadness, anger, guilt, and confusion, and how they affect your day-to-day life.

Therapy can help you:

- Make sense of the changes that loss brings
- Find ways to stay connected to what you've lost
- Process difficult emotions safely
- Reconnect with hope and meaning as you move forward

Grief is a natural response to loss. In therapy, you can begin to understand it, live with it, and gradually rebuild a sense of stability and peace.
